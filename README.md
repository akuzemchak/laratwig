# LaraTwig

_A simple [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) integration package for [Laravel](http://laravel.com/)._

## Warning

LaraTwig isn't quite ready for public use yet, so do so at your own risk!

## Why Twig?

Laravel ships with [Blade](http://laravel.com/docs/templates#blade-templating), which is a decent lightweight template engine. However, sometimes you need something a little more full-featured and powerful, and Twig is the clear leader in PHP template engines. If you're already familiar with Twig, then there's no point in explaining further... you already know the awesomeness. If you're new to Twig, check out the fantastic [documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation) to see what the fuss is all about.

## Why LaraTwig?

There already is a [great Twig package for Laravel](https://github.com/rcrowe/TwigBridge), and it's a lot more feature-rich than this one. My goal with LaraTwig is to have a simple and straightforward alternative that is easy to maintain and quick to implement.

## Installation and Usage

Coming soon...
